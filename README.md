# shiny-eureka
This has been a long standing project of mine to make a website that would be suitable for a comic. I just started to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The comic is outdated and non-canonical at this point so it wasnt about the content for me. I just had a lot of images for it lying around so that I could learn how to create a website. I love looking at other comic artist webpages and hope to one day make one that suits my comic with a lot of fun web design touches.
